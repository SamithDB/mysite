This is my Portfolio website. 


## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js on your machine. If you don't, please install it. You can install it via a package manager here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Clone this repository to your local machine. 

Navigate via your favorite cli (command line interface) to the folder this repo is cloned to.

First you need to install your node modules by running the command `npm i`.

Once those are downloded, you can then run the application by typing `node app.js` and hitting enter.

You will then be able to visit this site locally at http://localhost:port
